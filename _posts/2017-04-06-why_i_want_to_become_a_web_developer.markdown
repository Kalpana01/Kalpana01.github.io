When I browse through sites such as Amazon, I feel how cool it is to shop. Amazon makes our life simpler 
without moving from our couches; all we need is order on amazon and products will be at our door step.
Thanks to technology that made our shopping easier; this is what made me interested in learning
this technology. I feel making websites has artistic touch with a mix of creativity and logic.

 Software developement is a challenging job, at the same time not a boring field as we need to keep ourselves 
 updated every day.
 
 Even though I have Masters in computer applications, knowledge in Performance testing and certification in
 cloud technologies such as Salesforce, I discovered that developing websites is fun when I worked On Dotnet 
 project to build a website. So I decided to learn more about web development. As a first step, I started looking
 at different training bootcamps online and found that Flatiron School appeared to be the best. So, I chose to
 apply and enroll in this course. And here I am, working towards my goal.
