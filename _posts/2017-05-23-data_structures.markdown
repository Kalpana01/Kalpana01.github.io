**Data Structures** are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.  The following are the
various types of Data Structures:

* Stacks
* Queue
* Linked-lists
* Graphs
* Trees
* Array
* Hashes

The following are the various examples in which we can use Data Structures:

* You have to store social network “feeds”.  You do not know the size, andthings may need to be dynamically added.

* You need to store undo/redo operations in a word processor.

* You need to store the friendship information on a social networking site. i.e., who is friends with who.

* To implement printer spooler so that jobs can be printed in the order of their arrival.

* To store the possible moves in a chess game.

* To store the customer order information in a drive-in burger place.  (Customers keep on coming and they have to
  get their correct food at the payment/food collection window.)
